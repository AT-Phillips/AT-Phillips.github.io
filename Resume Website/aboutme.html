                <p>Extracurricular Projects</p>
                <p class="highlight-details">Since I started out learning programming with Java, I've worked 
                    on a few personal projects that were desktop based, including an inventory program that 
                    keeps track of things that sold on eBay. A good friend of mine uses it to sell his old 
                    childhood action figures!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="highlight-item">
                <p>Hobbies</p>
                <p class="highlight-details">In my spare time, I play guitar, among other instruments. 
                    I also write and record my own music for myself and friends when I have time. I'm self-taught, 
                    so it has been a difficult but rewarding journey! I also enjoy long walks with my Australian Shepard, Finn.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="highlight-item">
                <p>Related work experience</p>
                <p class="highlight-details">I currently work as a Quality Analyst at a local tech 
                    company here in Springfield, MO. I lead the test automation team and we generally 
                    use the Selenium framework suite alongside Python.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="highlight-item">
                <p>Anticipated graduation date</p>
                <p class="highlight-details">Between work and family duties, I'm typically
                    a half-time student. That said, I plan to graduate sometime around Spring 2025.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="highlight-item">
                <p>Degree and aspirations</p>
                <p class="highlight-details">I'm currently working towards my A.A.S in Computer Information Science. 
                    I've switched degree paths a few times but discovered a passion for programming, so here I am! 
                    I hope to one day build websites for people I know that own their own businesses.</p>
